<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-form-subsequence-with-target-sum/">2835. Minimum Operations to Form Subsequence With Target Sum</a></h2><h3>Hard</h3><hr><div><p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> array <code>nums</code> consisting of <strong>non-negative</strong> powers of <code>2</code>, and an integer <code>target</code>.</p>

<p>In one operation, you must apply the following changes to the array:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose any element of the array <code>nums[i]</code> such that <code>nums[i] &gt; 1</code>.</li>
	<li>Remove <code>nums[i]</code> from the array.</li>
	<li>Add <strong>two</strong> occurrences of <code>nums[i] / 2</code> to the <strong>end</strong> of <code>nums</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return the <em><strong>minimum number of operations</strong> you need to perform so that </em><code>nums</code><em> contains a <strong>subsequence</strong> whose elements sum to</em> <code>target</code>. If it is impossible to obtain such a subsequence, return <code>-1</code>.</p>

<p>A <strong>subsequence</strong> is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,2,8], target = 7
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In the first operation, we choose element nums[2]. The array becomes equal to nums = [1,2,4,4].
At this stage, nums contains the subsequence [1,2,4] which sums up to 7.
It can be shown that there is no shorter sequence of operations that results in a subsequnce that sums up to 7.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,32,1,2], target = 12
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In the first operation, we choose element nums[1]. The array becomes equal to nums = [1,1,2,16,16].
In the second operation, we choose element nums[3]. The array becomes equal to nums = [1,1,2,16,8,8]
At this stage, nums contains the subsequence [1,1,2,8] which sums up to 12.
It can be shown that there is no shorter sequence of operations that results in a subsequence that sums up to 12.</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,32,1], target = 35
<strong>Output:</strong> -1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> It can be shown that no sequence of operations results in a subsequence that sums up to 35.
