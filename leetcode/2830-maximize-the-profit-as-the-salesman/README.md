<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-the-profit-as-the-salesman/">2830. Maximize the Profit as the Salesman</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>You are given an integer <code>n</code> representing the number of houses on a number line, numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array <code>offers</code> where <code>offers[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>, gold<sub>i</sub>]</code>, indicating that <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> buyer wants to buy all the houses from <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>end<sub>i</sub></code> for <code>gold<sub>i</sub></code> amount of gold.</p>

<p>As a salesman, your goal is to <strong>maximize</strong> your earnings by strategically selecting and selling houses to buyers.</p>

<p>Return <em>the maximum amount of gold you can earn</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that different buyers can't buy the same house, and some houses may remain unsold.</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 5, offers = [[0,0,1],[0,2,2],[1,3,2]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are 5 houses numbered from 0 to 4 and there are 3 purchase offers.
We sell houses in the range [0,0] to 1<sup>st</sup> buyer for 1 gold and houses in the range [1,3] to 3<sup>rd</sup> buyer for 2 golds.
It can be proven that 3 is the maximum amount of gold we can achieve.
