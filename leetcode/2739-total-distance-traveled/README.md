<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/total-distance-traveled/">2739. Total Distance Traveled</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr><div><p>A truck has two fuel tanks. You are given two integers, <code>mainTank</code> representing the fuel present in the main tank in liters and <code>additionalTank</code> representing the fuel present in the additional tank in liters.</p>

<p>The truck has a mileage of <code>10</code> km per liter. Whenever <code>5</code> liters of fuel get&nbsp;used up in the main tank,&nbsp;if the additional tank has at least <code>1</code> liters of fuel, <code>1</code> liters of fuel will be transferred from the additional tank to the main tank.</p>

<p>Return <em>the maximum distance which can be traveled.</em></p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Injection from the additional tank is not continuous. It happens suddenly and immediately for every 5 liters consumed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> mainTank = 5, additionalTank = 10
<strong>Output:</strong> 60
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
After spending 5 litre of fuel, fuel remaining is (5 - 5 + 1) = 1 litre and distance traveled is 50km.
After spending another 1 litre of fuel, no fuel gets injected in the main tank and the main tank becomes empty.
Total distance traveled is 60km.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> mainTank = 1, additionalTank = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 10
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
After spending 1 litre of fuel, the main tank becomes empty.
Total distance traveled is 10km.

</pre>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= mainTank, additionalTank &lt;= 100</code></li>
</ul>
