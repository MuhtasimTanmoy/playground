<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-groups-to-create-a-valid-assignment/">2910. Minimum Number of Groups to Create a Valid Assignment</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>nums</code> of length <code>n</code>.</p>

<p>We want to group the indices so for each index <code>i</code> in the range <code>[0, n - 1]</code>, it is assigned to <strong>exactly one</strong> group.</p>

<p>A group<strong> </strong>assignment is <strong>valid</strong> if the following conditions hold:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For every group <code>g</code>, all indices <code>i</code> assigned to group <code>g</code> have the same value in <code>nums</code>.</li>
	<li>For any two groups <code>g<sub>1</sub></code> and <code>g<sub>2</sub></code>, the <strong>difference</strong> between the <strong>number of indices</strong> assigned to <code>g<sub>1</sub></code> and <code>g<sub>2</sub></code> should <strong>not exceed</strong> <code>1</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return <em>an integer denoting </em><em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of groups needed to create a valid group assignment.</em></p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,2,3,2,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> One way the indices can be assigned to 2 groups is as follows, where the values in square brackets are indices:
group 1 -&gt; [0,2,4]
group 2 -&gt; [1,3]
All indices are assigned to one group.
In group 1, nums[0] == nums[2] == nums[4], so all indices have the same value.
In group 2, nums[1] == nums[3], so all indices have the same value.
The number of indices assigned to group 1 is 3, and the number of indices assigned to group 2 is 2.
Their difference doesn't exceed 1.
It is not possible to use fewer than 2 groups because, in order to use just 1 group, all indices assigned to that group must have the same value.
Hence, the answer is 2.</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [10,10,10,3,1,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> One way the indices can be assigned to 4 groups is as follows, where the values in square brackets are indices:
group 1 -&gt; [0]
group 2 -&gt; [1,2]
group 3 -&gt; [3]
group 4 -&gt; [4,5]
The group assignment above satisfies both conditions.
It can be shown that it is not possible to create a valid assignment using fewer than 4 groups.
Hence, the answer is 4.</pre>
