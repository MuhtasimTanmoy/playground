<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> 
RequestAccepted table:
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/09  |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
<strong>Output:</strong> 
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 3  | 3   |
+----+-----+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
The person with id 3 is a friend of people 1, 2, and 4, so he has three friends in total, which is the most number than any others.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Follow up:</strong> In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends. Could you find all these people in this case?</p>
