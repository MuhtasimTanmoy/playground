<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-losers-of-the-circular-game/">2682. Find the Losers of the Circular Game</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr><div><p>There are <code>n</code> friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code> in <strong>clockwise order</strong>. More formally, moving clockwise from the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> friend brings you to the <code>(i+1)<sup>th</sup></code> friend for <code>1 &lt;= i &lt; n</code>, and moving clockwise from the <code>n<sup>th</sup></code> friend brings you to the <code>1<sup>st</sup></code> friend.</p>

<p>The rules of the game are as follows:</p>

<p><code>1<sup>st</sup></code> friend receives the ball.</p>

<ul>
	<li>After that, <code>1<sup>st</sup></code> friend passes it to the friend who is <code>k</code> steps away from them in the <strong>clockwise</strong> direction.</li>
	<li>After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is <code>2 * k</code> steps away from them in the <strong>clockwise</strong> direction.</li>
	<li>After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is <code>3 * k</code> steps away from them in the <strong>clockwise</strong> direction, and so on and so forth.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> turn, the friend holding the ball should pass it to the friend who is <code>i * k</code> steps away from them in the <strong>clockwise</strong> direction.</p>

<p>The game is finished when some friend receives the ball for the second time.</p>

<p>The <strong>losers</strong> of the game are friends who did not receive the ball in the entire game.</p>

<p>Given the number of friends, <code>n</code>, and an integer <code>k</code>, return <em>the array answer, which contains the losers of the game in the <strong>ascending</strong> order</em>.</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 5, k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> [4,5]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The game goes as follows:
1) Start at 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;friend and pass the ball to the friend who is 2 steps away from them - 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;friend.
2) 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;friend passes the ball to the friend who is 4 steps away from them - 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;friend.
3) 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;friend passes the ball to the friend who is 6 steps away from them  - 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;friend.
4) The game ends as 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;friend receives the ball for the second time.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 4, k = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> [2,3,4]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The game goes as follows:
1) Start at the 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;friend and pass the ball to the friend who is 4 steps away from them - 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;friend.
2) The game ends as 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;friend receives the ball for the second time.
