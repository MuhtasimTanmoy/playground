- Messenger IOS

- Chat, Group Chat module, and Connection managenment
    - There are so many micro interactions
    - In case I am sharing any media and the network is down, manage delivered, seen acknowledgement of all messages
    - The message needed to sync from other devices
    - Also after the network is connected all messages that were failed or pending needed to be send again
    - There are around 45-50 types of message and each would trigger different task, some would trigger 4-5 independent task. 
    - Like location, seen, displayed, media, theme, reply message. Like for group message we sort of needed to track each message is seen by which member at which time stamp.
    - No shared variable, after every 15 days I refactored portion of it to make amendments for my lack of discipline
    - `tail -23000 ejabberd.log | head -50`
    - There was lots of custom XML parsing, unit testing sort of very much accelerated this process, and we sort of have github action validating this process
    - Events for analytics which feature is mostly being used by our users
    - Minimum code change to achieve the result
    - Each group creation, member addition required 5-6 round trip to server

- Call
    - I worked on our webrtc connection meta exchange handshake
    - Stun server 
        - It is just a reflection server, you make a call, you get meta the ip it was requested, 
        cause our device can be behind a NAT
    - Turn server
    - SDP providing the client capabilities, like for audio opus codec, video vp8 codec
    - ICE candidate provides the information about the ipaddress and port from where the data is going to be exchanged.
    - The data channel has multiplexing for other types of data

- Bitcode Enable
    - I'm not sure at what level you are looking for an answer at, so let's take a little trip. Some of this you may already know.
    -  When you build your project, Xcode invokes clang for Objective-C targets and swift/swiftc for Swift targets. Both of these compilers compile the app to an intermediate representation (IR), one of these IRs is bitcode. From this IR, a program called LLVM takes over and creates the binaries needed for x86 32 and 64 bit modes (for the simulator) and arm6/arm7/arm7s/arm64 (for the device). Normally, all of these different binaries are lumped together in a single file called a fat binary.
    - The ENABLE_BITCODE option cuts out this final step. It creates a version of the app with an IR bitcode binary. This has a number of nice features, but one giant drawback: it can't run anywhere. In order to get an app with a bitcode binary to run, the bitcode needs to be recompiled (maybe assembled or transcodedâ€¦ I'm not sure of the correct verb) into an x86 or ARM binary.
    - When a bitcode app is submitted to the App Store, Apple will do this final step and create the finished binaries.
