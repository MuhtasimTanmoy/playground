The common guidance is to avoid using words that don't mean much, like using great, good, developed, built, used, etc. 
Instead, use better action words like Drove/lead, Negotiated, Achieved, etc sounds better.

Also, Quantifiable points are always preferred, for example:
Achieved 40% less bundle size using tree shaking in a React UI library.

Achieved 30% less app size by compiling dependent framework binary with bitcode.
Compiled dependent framework with bitcode  to reduce app size by around 30%.
Just one sentence that says, what someone did, how they did it, and what result did it bring.

Also, as most of the time, the 1st screening happens on ATS, having a robot-readable resume is important. 
Also to be relevant to HR, it's very important to use keywords matching the job description.

- A peer-to-peer (P2P) network connecting participants and propagating transac‐
tions and blocks of verified transactions, based on a standardized “gossip”
protocol
• Messages, in the form of transactions, representing state transitions
• A set of consensus rules, governing what constitutes a transaction and what
makes for a valid state transition
• A state machine that processes transactions according to the consensus rules
• A chain of cryptographically secured blocks that acts as a journal of all the veri‐
fied and accepted state transitions
• A consensus algorithm that decentralizes control over the blockchain, by forcing
participants to cooperate in the enforcement of the consensus rules
• A game-theoretically sound incentivization scheme (e.g., proof-of-work costs
plus block rewards) to economically secure the state machine in an open
environment
• One or more open source software implementations of the above (“clients”)
