Applied on the website and was directly contacted by a hiring manager for an interview. 
So far it has consisted of a tech screen + a full day virtual onsite consisting of five interviewers.

Tech screen was me talking with the hiring manager of a team for the first half, and the second half was a leetcode style question. If I remember correctly it had to do with the average of an incoming data stream, but the incoming data had separate groups specified by a key, so you had to take the average of that group. Then some follow-up questions on how I'd go about developing such a system in a production sense where you cant really frequently change the code (config files for parameterization, databases for storage , etc).

The virtual onsite was 6 hours with 5 1-hour interviews, and a break in the middle.

15 minute behavioral + 2 Leetcode style questions.
Questions were Coin Change, but the problem statement implied it could be done greedily since it has the 1 cent coin in the set that he said would never change. If not, you'd have to do the DP approach.
Second question was "find the k smallest integers in an unsorted array." So a variation of this problem where quickselect is the optimal and solution.

15 minute behavioral + 1 Leetcode style question with several follow ups.
The question was a variation of binary search where you are trying to find an element in an unsorted array where the adjacent elements are both greater than the element. By looking at the bounds, you can then find how you need to shrink the window for binary search.

15 minute behavioral + 1 leetcode style question with several follow-ups.
Question was the "number of islands" problem, however the islands weren't all ones, but any positive integer which specified the elevation at a given point. I was told to find the number of islands plus return a list of the highest points for each island.

15 minute behavioral + 2 leetcode.
First question was removing duplicate elements from a sorted linked list. Follow up was addressing how to do it in an unsorted way.
Second Question was literally just valid paranthesis.

1 Hour Behavioral.
This one had someone who was a little more senior to the company, and who was on a different team at OCI. Great experience and allowed me to ask a lot more questions my other interviewers weren't able to give full answers to.

Currently waiting on an offer, but have a call scheduled for later so I'm suspecting I will get an offer.


n last few months I received many messages to suggest how to prepare oneself for FAANG. I think this resources will be beneficial for them.
