# Intro
Hello, how are you? Hope you are having a very good day.

As we are little short of time lets jum inot it right now.

I will quickly share CV with you so you can look at it and ask me anything regarding it. In the meantime I will be explaining in brief about what I currently do.

- https://bit.ly/tanmoycv

Would you kindly tell me know how much technical details I need to put in about my work?


# Company Intro

First little about the company I am working on so you can assess the scale and type of service that I have been exposed to.

I will share some links as well about the company.

- https://www.databird.co
- https://ridmik.com

This is the first company I joined as full time after my graduation. 

My main motivation joining here was that it has one of the largest acquired userbase in our country surpassing over 34 million active users. 

I have worked at two other comapnies before in conjunction to my study. One as research intern and another as full stack developer on javascript framework & react.

# My Current role

- ## Messenger

Working on an iOS encrypted messaging app backed by an erlang XMPP messaging server

This is the signature product of our company

And when we started developing the iOS counterpart, the android messaging app was already is a usable state as it's developement started way early

https://ridmik.com

When we started developing it, my main responsiblity was to quickly match it with the android counterpart and study proper xmpp protocol to do that properly. Also as there was already deployed version of apps in the market while changing, optimizing any protocol it needed to main proper backward compatibility.
Note that it required lots of study on XMPP protocol.

> Now for the design, as you can see the app all chat related design, custom messages like online status, profile management, message request, media management, reaction, reply message, forwarding, message acknowledgement, in group seeing which member has received your messages so far, seen your messages so far, at which particular time, localization, sharing any photo text, link from other device, 

Also local persistence for all states because when offline I will be seeing all the contents.

`The hardest part I faced was concurrency handle.` Like each message will trigger multiple api calls like profile info fetch, info from xmpp server, sending acknowledgemnts, peristence. Now if my device comes back online after a while and it has 1000 of awaiting messages there are lots of cornercase that I needed to handle.

Like our group chat is solely dependant on publish subscribe and it required member management, their access role management all from clients.

Also I worked on the notification management portion, not just on the client but also on the server on erlang language as I was pretty familiar with the server components and behaviour. I differentiated fcm push notification sending to android clients and iOS clients.

Then I needed to work on Signal End to End Encryption. I needed to explore open source implementation, look at signal standard and make it compatible with android.

Then I worked on single one to one call. Call notification manangement, audio, video call, screen sharing portion. 
> It required propietary handshake protocol usage to exchange SDP,
Candidates the metadata generated by the library, then flowing through different state

<!-- Sqlite Persistence
Data modeling
Chat UI for all different types of messages
Those models changed -->

- ## Ad Server

 - [All Android Apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6373819058374763586)

To monetize those apps we needed an Adserver.

Developed an microservice in Django. Designed schema, and optimized Django rest API SQL queries. Used load testing and Redis caching as


Created an advertising platform manager web app in React. Features include campaign management, analytics
dashboard, and single page card/ banner editor app with all generic editing facilities.

I had previous experience working on backend and react.

> In order to load faster, I made the code splitted the js bundle and load the structure at first, then for image banner processing I extensively used background task.

- ## Summary

Currently fascinated by swift and how fast the whole ecosystem adopts new changes. 

All those ecosystem I have worked so far, swift is by far most organized and fast ecosystem.

# SmartCrowd

Now lets jump to the blockchian internship I did, when I was in my final year.

Note that my undergrad thesis is on blockchain where I got familiar with various internals of blockchain. Mainly ethereum based layer 0 tools. Based on my performance there I worked directly with a compnay under the supervision of my professor.

- One submission currently being under review on a conference which in on blockchain, another published last month.

I had wish to continue to go deeper in leyer 0, like decentralized file system, storage, filecoin protocol, and work on it's internal.

- https://smartcrowd.ae

- Worked on a proof of concept project decentralized property share market to turn properties into ERC721 NFT tokens
- Managed smart contract development, deployment, RPC interaction & custom wallet in Meteor web app.
- Technologies: Ethereum, Truffle Suite, Web3.js, Ganache CLI & Geth, React, Meteor, MongoDB.

<!-- //  -->

## Big-O LTD

Started out as full stack developer with [meteor](https://www.meteor.com) which is a full stack framework and for front end used react.

I first got familair with project management, task management there. Also about deployments.

Worked on Full Stack MVP development & deployment which helped analyze market dynamics.

- Built geolocation-based crowdsourced traffic incident monitoring web MVP. Site: https://rsp.com.bd

- Worked on digital prescription storage, review, and management web app.

Technologies: Meteor, React, MongoDB, Nginx.

## NOT NOW

<!-- //  -->

I wanted to work on low level.
I did deplyed smart contract there just compiled and sent the evm bytecode 

evm being a stack based machine

something that involves os kernel knowledge, networking, concurrency, security and develop mental model for those so I needed a company that has lots of users so I can be exposed to problems which are faced when we are operating at scale

<!-- //  -->

I knew about rest, sql, orm usage. Already had backend exp.

Present Ad to already existing clients, track it properly, and count impressions which is just user conversions and other task like seen it or not

# I ask question
- How does performance evaluated at your company?
- You cant improve something you cant measure, test.
- Suppose I am novice, and I cant understand the decision making. What ways there is to make me understand.
- What are characteristics of a successful employee?
- Can you give me an example of a time when the company did something that hurt their interest because it believed it was the right thing?

- Rust crypto storage platform
    - https://github.com/MuhtasimTanmoy/forest

the signal encryption part required understanding the rust library that has been used and many open source implementation

https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/issues/361

Audio video call module module,
erlang used for whatsapp backend as well

Built from scratch modules for core single, group messaging with proper XMPP specification. Managed data modeling, media, SQLitepersistence,proprietaryprotocolproposal &implementation while keeping backward
compatibility across deployed versions & platforms.

Implemented end-to-end encryption (Signal Protocol) for single and group chat with key & device management.

Worked on WebRTC signaling, audio, video call connection & flow. Maintain code with MVVM & reactive
architecture while keeping over 96% of devices on average crash-free.

Modified erlang server notification module to optimize support for half a million active clients.

Enabled bitcode.

Technologies: iOS, Django, React, Erlang, XMPP, WebRTC, Signal Encryption.

I personally like pair programming.

- Run migration across builds to ensure the protocol changes are properly reflected in local persistence.
- Also, there are some optimizations like reply message reference which was later denormalized
- reconcilliation of chats
- Archival service
- It's better to double check first, then having 3-4 iterations to revisit 
- It's quicker writing code that works without making it maintainable

`Shared-state concurrency` and `Message-passing concurrency`

Our culture promotes frequent tech switching.

- Write down the question. So you don't forget.
- Stay on track
- Resahping the question
- Take video of your explanation and rewatch to find cases
- No industry jargons, listen carefully
- How much detail I should go into 
- I just want to check If I am giving you the right amount of detail
