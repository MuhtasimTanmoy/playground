Interview
1. Recruiter reached out through LinkedIn 2. Assignment, currency conversion app, 7 days time limit 3. Recruiter interview 30min 4. First technical interview & live coding 60 min Now i feel this is waste of time and effort. All are online interview and it took almost 15 days

Following my interview experiences

PayPay :
There are 6 rounds - Online coding test, Phone Screen, and followed by four loop rounds
Online coding test :
There are two coding question and those are between easy-medium leedcode standard. But some boundary conditions need to be taken care, and also be careful about the double/ floating comparision.
Once I have through I have been called for a phone screen.

Phone screen 1 hour:
This round mostly on common discuusion about my profile and work experience I have. Mostly on the current role.

1st Loop Round 1 hour:
This was a purely technical round. discusiion started with intriducing each other and followed by why PayPay. Initially there are few theoritical questions. there are 3 coding problem asked first two of them we discussed on the approach - what are Data Structure going to use, complexity etc. Both are leetcode mdium level one of them from Array and other from List and Hash. Then asked a Leetcode Hard peoblem on Priority Queue and interviewer was expecting me write the code. I gave two different approch but better optomised solution was possible. After a hint able to catch that and able to explain the approch only no time to write the code.

2nd Loopp round - 1 hour
This is also same as the first loop round. Interviewer initially asked some basic Data structures and system design basic questions. Then asked a coding problem, which I feel a leetcode medium problem. I solved this with recursion and in followup he asked me to optimese it and then came up with DP solution.

3rd Loop Round 1 hour
This round as well started with some basic Java questions and then a leetcode medium problem which requires map to solve the one and there were some tricky math calculations.

4th Loop round 1 hour
This round mostly on design (System architecture). Asked few questions on different problem scenarios and looking for my approches some of them related to fintech domain.

After a day or two came to know the feedback is positive.

Overall interview experience were nicely coordinated but I felt coding interviews they are too much going to theoritical part.

Wise Interview Experience

There are 5 rounds - HR, Pair Coding, Technical, Product Interview and Lead Interview

HR
In this round HR mostly looks your skills and motivation. Lot of questions I have been asked why this company, why the different country and I have already multiple offers from abroad so why Wise etc.

Pair Programing 1 Hour
This is was an wonderful round and experience. Interviwer was so friendly and did not went on traditional approach, instead asked a problem based on my experience of work as both of them have overlap on domain. I could solve the problem as I am using such services in my day to day work experience and some optimization and trade off around the problem.

Technical Round 1.5 Hour
This round there are 3 panelist. focused on behavioral, team lead, project estimation and deployment etc in first half and in second half given a design problem and was expecting both LLD(OOAD) and HLD (compoenent level interactions) and discussed different tradeoff on the approches. This was not tradtional design problem though - mix off Algorithm, OOAD and System Design.

Product Interview 1 hour
This round mostly focued on the Products and Process related. And some scenario based questions mostly how we follow in Agile and also focused on SDLC part and pos and cons

Lead round
There are two Managers were as panelist. This si purely on the behavioral aspects. Learning, mistake, conflict handling and project management and leadership

After all got call from HR on the offer. Overall very nice and unique interview experience. Learned many things with the discussion definitely.
