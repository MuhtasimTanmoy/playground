- Lighting network
- Layer 2 solution, as not transaction are settled on blockchain 
    - Dramatic increase in transacton speed speed and throughput
- Increase block size, bitcoin cash approach
- Part of transaction approach
- Payment channels
    - State channels
- Bolt standard
- Hashtime lock contract
-  Payment channels are examples of state channels which represent an off-chain state alteration which is secured by eventual settlement on the blockchain.
- The communication between LN nodes is encrypted point-to-point. The Lightning Network achieves that by implementing an onion-routed protocol (similar to TOR) which ensures that intermediate nodes can verify and decrypt only their portion of the route and they cannot identify the length of the payment path or their own position in the path.
-  These are mostly timelocks, asymmetric revocable commitments and HTLC.

    - Optimistic rollup
        - Post data to layer 1 and assume it's correct
        - Use fraud proofs
        - Withdrawal time long, so liquidity exits given by hop protocol and connext
