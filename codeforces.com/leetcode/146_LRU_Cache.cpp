// https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/

// Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and put.

// get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
// put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.

// The cache is initialized with a positive capacity.

// Follow up:
// Could you do both operations in O(1) time complexity?
